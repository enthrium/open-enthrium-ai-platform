## Architecture

Open Enterprise has two deployment modes — the **Platform** (full web application) and the **Runtime** (standalone CLI binary). Both share the same underlying agent execution engine.

## OE Runtime — Single Binary Agent Executor

OE Runtime is a standalone, cross-platform agent executor. No server. No database. No Node.js install required. Point it at a YAML agent file and run.

### Download

| Platform | Binary | Size |
|----------|--------|------|
| **Windows** | [oe-runtime-win.exe](https://github.com/openenterprise-info/open-enterprise-community/releases/latest/download/oe-runtime-win.exe) | ~141 MB |
| **Linux** | [oe-runtime-linux](https://github.com/openenterprise-info/open-enterprise-community/releases/latest/download/oe-runtime-linux) | ~179 MB |
| **macOS** | [oe-runtime-macos](https://github.com/openenterprise-info/open-enterprise-community/releases/latest/download/oe-runtime-macos) | ~167 MB |
| **Sample library** | [oe-runtime-samples.zip](https://github.com/openenterprise-info/open-enterprise-community/releases/latest/download/oe-runtime-samples.zip) | 20 ready-to-run `agent.yaml` + `oe-config.json` starter kits |
| **Postman collection** | [oe-runtime.postman_collection.json](https://github.com/openenterprise-info/open-enterprise-community/releases/latest/download/oe-runtime.postman_collection.json) | — |

> Links always point to the **latest release**. Binaries are built automatically via GitHub Actions on every version tag across all three platforms simultaneously.

### Usage

```bash
# Run an agent
oe-runtime agent.yaml --config oe-config.json

# Pass parameters (substitutes {{key}} in instructions and steps)
oe-runtime market-report.yaml \
  --config oe-config.json \
  --param company="Tesla" \
  --param recipient="ceo@company.com"

# Start as an HTTP API server
oe-runtime --serve --config oe-config.json

# Show help
oe-runtime --help
```

### Config File

Create `oe-config.json` with your credentials (or download a starter kit from the [Sample Library](https://github.com/openenterprise-info/open-enterprise-community/releases/latest/download/oe-runtime-samples.zip)):

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "provider": "openai",
    "apiKey": "sk-...",
    "model": "gpt-4o"
  },
  "connectors": [
    {
      "connection_name": "My Database",
      "connection_type": "postgres",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 5432,
      "user": "postgres",
      "password": "...",
      "database": "mydb"
    },
    {
      "connection_name": "Perplexity Search",
      "connection_type": "perplexity-search",
      "apiKey": "pplx-..."
    },
    {
      "connection_name": "Company Email",
      "connection_type": "smtp",
      "host": "smtp.zoho.com",
      "port": 465,
      "secure": true,
      "user": "you@yourcompany.com",
      "pass": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

`connection_name` in the config must match `connection_name` in the agent YAML — that is how the runtime links credentials to connectors.

Supported LLM providers: `openai`, `anthropic`, `azure`, `groq`, `gemini`, `ollama`, `mistral`, `deepseek`, `together`, `fireworks`, and more.

### HTTP Server Mode

Set `server.enabled: true` in `oe-config.json` to turn OE Runtime into a persistent HTTP API server. Call agents from mobile apps, web services, scripts, or any HTTP client — no Node.js or Docker needed on the client side.

```json
{
  "llm": { "provider": "openai", "apiKey": "sk-...", "model": "gpt-4o" },
  "server": {
    "enabled": true,
    "port": 3333,
    "apiKey": "your-secret-api-key"
  },
  "connectors": [ ... ]
}
```

```bash
oe-runtime
# 🚀  OE Runtime Server  v1.3.5
# Listening  http://localhost:3333
```

> You can also use the `--serve` flag to activate server mode without editing the config: `oe-runtime --serve`

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/health` | `GET` | Liveness check — returns `{ status, version }` |
| `/run` | `POST` | Run an agent from an inline YAML string |
| `/run-file` | `POST` | Run an agent from a YAML file path on disk |

**Example — POST /run:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3333/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-secret-key" \
  -d '{
    "yaml": "name: Hello\nsteps:\n  - name: Say hello",
    "params": {}
  }'
```

```json
{ "success": true, "output": "Hello! How can I help you today?", "duration_ms": 1823 }
```

**`apiKey`** protects all endpoints with an `x-api-key` header. **`port`** defaults to `3333`. Both are optional.

| **Multi-user** | No | Yes — workspaces and RBAC |
| **Persistence** | None | SQLite / PostgreSQL |
| **Agent authoring** | YAML file in any editor | YAML editor + visual builder |
| **RAG** | Not yet *(roadmap)* | Yes — full ingestion and retrieval pipeline |
| **Scheduling** | External cron / task scheduler | Built-in cron expression scheduler |
| **Human approval** | Not yet *(roadmap)* | Yes — built-in |
| **Platforms** | Windows, Linux, macOS | Any Docker host, Kubernetes, bare metal |

You can use both together: author and test agents with OE Runtime locally, then deploy them to the Platform for scheduling, multi-user access, and governance.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Yes | — | Signs and verifies login tokens. Keep the same value across restarts — changing it logs everyone out. |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` | Yes | — | Email for the super admin account |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | — | Password for the super admin account |
| `FRONTEND_PORT` | No | `3000` | Vite dev server port |
| `SERVER_PORT` | No | `3001` | API server port |
| `PROCESSOR_PORT` | No | `3002` | Document processor port |
| `LICENSE_TYPE` | No | `community` | Edition identifier |

All LLM, embedding, and vector database settings are configured from the admin panel inside the app — no `.env` changes needed after initial setup.
